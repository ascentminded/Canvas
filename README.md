# Canvas
Pygame-based game that allows you to explore a large canvas (background image).

Canvas is intended to be used to display large art worlds. I was inspired by the works of Kim Jung Gi and Randall Munroe's [xkcd: Hovercraft](https://xkcd.com/1608/) to turn my comic art into a multi stage comic that had to be explored, as though you were drifting through it, viewing only a panel at a time.
While the canvas that I created was solely for myself and my friends, the code I built for it is usable for any large background image, or your own worlds

### How to
You need the pygame package installed in python, and you need python (This was built on python 3.8) to run the canvas_game.py file.
To play this game, you need a folder called images in the same location where you save 'canvas_game.py'. In it, you need a 'hero.png', character sprite that you control and a 'stage.png' background image that you explore.
I drew a 128x119 sprite for 'hero' and  13338x8208 background for 'stage'. (I've also worked in 2608x1480, background size just has to be larger than hero sprite)

I have included a sprite, but my stage artwork is a little too personal to add here.
Regardless, you can have fun exploring just about any large image, and I've used this photo (6000x4000) by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@hyejoon514?utm_content=creditCopyText&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=unsplash">hyejoon Kim</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/a-wall-covered-in-lots-of-different-colored-pictures-t5y7TlX3q4U?utm_content=creditCopyText&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=unsplash">Unsplash</a> as a placeholder.
