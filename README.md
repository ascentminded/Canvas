# Canvas
Pygame-based game that allows you to explore a large canvas (background image).

To play this game, you need a folder called images in the same location where you save 'canvas_game.py'. In it, you need a 'hero.png', character sprite that you control and a 'stage.png' background image that you explore.
I drew a 128x119 sprite for 'hero' and 2608x1480 background for 'stage'.
I have included a sprite, but I'm not comfortable adding my stage artwork.

Regardless, you can have fun exploring just about any large image, and I've used this photo (6000x4000) by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@hyejoon514?utm_content=creditCopyText&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=unsplash">hyejoon Kim</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/photos/a-wall-covered-in-lots-of-different-colored-pictures-t5y7TlX3q4U?utm_content=creditCopyText&utm_medium=referral&utm_source=unsplash">Unsplash</a> as a placeholder.
